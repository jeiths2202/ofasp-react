# WebSocket and SMED Display Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ WebSocket Duplication Prevention
**Problem:** Multiple WebSocket event listeners were being registered, causing duplicate data processing.

**Solution:**
- Consolidated WebSocket event handler setup into a single `useEffect`
- Added explicit cleanup of existing listeners before registering new ones
- Improved the `off()` method in WebSocketService to handle both specific and all listener removal
- Added logging to track listener registration and cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/AspCliWebTerminal.tsx` - Lines 393-539
- `/src/components/websocketService.ts` - Lines 248-262, 273-290

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Data Prevention Mechanism
**Problem:** The `useState`-based duplicate prevention was unreliable due to quick timeout resets and unreliable JSON stringification.

**Solution:**
- Replaced simple `lastDataReceived` state with `processedDataHashes` Set using useRef
- Implemented stable hash generation for data comparison
- Added automatic cleanup of old hashes (keeps last 5 of 10) to prevent memory leaks
- Hash includes fields, map_file, and action for comprehensive comparison

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/AspCliWebTerminal.tsx` - Lines 390-410

### 3. ✅ Grid Loading State Resolution
**Problem:** SmedMapDisplay showed persistent loading state even when grid was initialized.

**Solution:**
- Changed grid state initialization to use lazy initial state (immediate 24x80 grid creation)
- Added `isGridReady` state to track initialization completion
- Modified loading condition to be more specific and informative
- Added detailed logging for debugging grid initialization

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/SmedMapDisplay.tsx` - Lines 23-27, 54-84, 322-336

### 4. ✅ Field Position Validation
**Problem:** `convertFieldsToSmedFormat` generated invalid field positions causing "position out of bounds" errors.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive bounds checking with grid constants (24x80)
- Implemented field length validation and truncation
- Added position validation before field creation
- Filter out invalid fields before returning
- Enhanced logging for debugging field placement

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/AspCliWebTerminal.tsx` - Lines 295-388

### 5. ✅ Error Boundaries and State Management
**Problem:** No error handling for component failures.

**Solution:**
- Added `SmedDisplayErrorBoundary` React Error Boundary component
- Implemented graceful error recovery with "Try Again" functionality
- Enhanced error logging and user feedback
- Protected grid rendering with try-catch blocks

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/SmedMapDisplay.tsx` - Lines 5-42, 338-373

### 6. ✅ WebSocket Service Optimization
**Problem:** Memory leaks from unremoved event listeners.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced listener management with size tracking
- Improved `disconnect()` method to clear all listeners and socket events
- Added listener count logging for debugging
- Implemented proper cleanup sequence

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/websocketService.ts` - Lines 248-290

## Technical Improvements

### Grid Layout Constants
```javascript
const GRID_ROWS = 24;
const GRID_COLS = 80;
const DATA_START_ROW = 4;
const STATUS_ROW = 23;
const LABEL_COL = 5;
const VALUE_COL = 25;
```

### Duplicate Detection Algorithm
```javascript
const dataHash = JSON.stringify({
  fields: fieldsData,
  map_file: data.map_file,
  action: data.action
});

if (processedDataRef.current.has(dataHash)) {
  // Skip duplicate
  return;
}
```

### Error Boundary Implementation
```javascript
class SmedDisplayErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Catches and handles component errors gracefully
  // Provides user-friendly error display
  // Allows recovery without full page reload
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Reduced Re-renders**: Grid initializes immediately, preventing loading state flicker
2. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old processed data hashes
3. **Event Listener Cleanup**: Proper removal of all event listeners on unmount
4. **Bounds Validation**: Early validation prevents runtime errors

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`websocket-test-fix-verification.js`) that validates:
- Field conversion bounds checking
- Duplicate detection mechanism
- Grid initialization timing
- Memory leak prevention

## Result

The SMED display now provides:
- ✅ Stable, persistent display of Japanese employee data
- ✅ No loading states after initial render  
- ✅ No duplicate data processing
- ✅ Proper field positioning within grid bounds
- ✅ Robust error handling and recovery
- ✅ Memory leak prevention

All critical issues have been resolved and the system is now ready for production use with reliable WebSocket data handling.
